            <h2>About Guilty Gear</h2>

            <div class="origin">
            <h3>Origin</h3>
            <p>Guilty Gear is a series of fighting games by Arc System Works, created and designed by artist Daisuke
                Ishiwatari. The first game was published in 1998, and has spawned several sequels. It has also adapted
                to other media such as manga and drama CD. Guilty Gear has generally received praise from video game
                reviewers for its highly technical gameplay, graphics, soundtrack, and for its characters.
                <br>
                <br>
                Guilty Gear consists primarily of one-on-one competitive battles. Players are tasked with depleting
                their opponent's life gauge by utilizing attacks unique to each playable character. In the case of timed
                matches, the player with the most remaining life when time runs out is the victor of that round. The
                series' emphasis on speed and technicality and introduction of unique movement options such as an "air
                dash" would ultimately become the foundation for the "anime" subgenre of fighting games.
